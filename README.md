# Immutable-Passport-Integration
This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Immutable Passport into a simple Node.js application. We'll also provide a basic example app that demonstrates the integration.

Before we dive into the integration steps, let's take a look at the sample app. The sample app is a basic web application that allows users to log in using Immutable Passport and displays their nickname, ID token, and access token.

1.Clone the Sample App
You can clone the sample app from our GitHub repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/sample-immutable-passport-app
cd sample-immutable-passport-app

2. Install Dependencies
In the project directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

npm install

3. Set Up Immutable Passport
Register your application on the Immutable Developer Hub to obtain API keys.
In the config.js file, replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' and 'YOUR_API_SECRET' with your actual API keys.

Run the App
To start the app, run the following command:

npm start

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use the sample app.
